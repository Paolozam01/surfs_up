## Overview of the analysis:

The porpuse of this analysis is to analyze the weather trends on Oahu, Hawaii because I want to open a surfing and ice cream shop in this island. I am going to invest on this project together with another investor but he is concerned about the weather in this location because he invested on a similar business some years ago but it closed due to weather conditions. This code analyzes the weather contions and will help me and other investors decide the opening locations of this business and determin if it will be successful. 

## Results

On the code that was developed for this analysis, I was able to determine the temperature for the months June and December and was able to determine the precipitation and temperatures of September and February.
